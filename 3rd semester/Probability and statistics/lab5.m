% problem gives u the details! 
% to be able to use comments
% knowing how to explain the code in the comments (what is s^2, what is chi2inv)

% var(x) usually computes s^2
% s^2 - variance of the sample
% sigma^2 - variance of the population
% var(x,1) usually computes sigma^2

% type help var

% set of data: [20 20 20 20 11 11 11] <=> [20 11 / 4 3] - vector
% write that vector as: x = [20*ones(1,4),11*ones(1,3)]

% Find how the functions cov, corrcoef work!

% RULES PRACTICAL:
% - after holidays.
% - problems are just aplications. VERY similar to what we've done 
% - we have to bring ALL the laboratories
% - we dont have to start a program from scrach
% - just to use the material that we have. to mix the data and to solve it
% - the practical exam aprox 20-25 minutes
% 70% final exam
% 30% seminar + lab (matched somehow idk)
