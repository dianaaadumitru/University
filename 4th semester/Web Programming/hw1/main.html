                <h1>A day of my life</h1>
                <p>7:30 am: Beep. Beep. Beep.<br><br>

                    There’s that weird thing again. It happens every morning just after the giant light outside comes up. I still have yet to figure out <br> what makes that sound. It might be the human. I hope she isn’t going to explode.<br><br>

                    Why isn’t she up yet? Doesn’t she know I need to check on the squirrels?<br><br>

                    If she won’t get up I’ll have to do it myself. I’ll drag myself off my soft green doggy bed and, to wake her up, make my way over <br> to the human’s giant bed. I wish I had a bed that large.<br><br>

                    Wake…Up! I think as I poke her with my cold, wet nose. I start licking her delicious cheek as she giggles.<br><br>

                    “Alright, alright. I’ll take you outside.”<br><br>

                    Outside? Outside?! We’re going outside!!<br><br>

                    I start jumping around uncontrollably. But can you blame me? It’s outside!<br><br>

                    Soon I’m running down the stairs and bounding across the yard with Lily, my furry canine accomplice. I smell something familiar…<br><br>

                    “SQUIRRELS!!” Lily and I both shout at the same time. Next, we’re running from tree to tree jumping in the air trying to reach <br> those pesky rodents. One of these days we’ll get them.<br><br>
                    The rest of the day goes as usual – eat, sleep, bathroom break, sleep, and eat again. A wonderful day if you ask me.
